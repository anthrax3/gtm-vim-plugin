# Vim Git Time Metrics (GTM) Plugin
### Simple, seamless, lightweight time tracking for all your git projects

GTM, or GIT Time Metrics, is a utility that tracks activity on files that are part of a GIT repository 
and aggregates that activity into useful time information. It tracks this time through the use of editor 
plugins and by using GIT post-commit hooks. These timings and data are stored in the local GIT repo in GIT notes. 
This plugin will track this data for projects that are edited with the Vim editor.
